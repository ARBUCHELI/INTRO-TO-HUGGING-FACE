# INTRO TO HUGGING FACE
-----------------------

* Repositories
--------------
Learn about how to find pre-trained models and datasets on the Hugging Face hub for machine learning tasks.

Key ideas:

	. The Hugging Face hub is a platform for sharing pre-trained models and datasets for machine learning tasks.

	. Users can search for models and datasets by task or keyword and sort them by popularity, trending, or recent updates.

	. Each model or dataset page on the Hugging Face Hub contains important information (like training methods or limitations), community interaction features, and tools for importing 
	in your own code.

	. Hugging Face’s tasks page contains crash-course information on common ML/AI tasks such as image classification.

Question: how might the Hugging Face Hub help you get started exploring the ML space?
---------

* See our answer
----------------
	. One option would be to browse the Hugging Face hub, looking at the different models and datasets available to see if something sparks an idea about something you might want to 
	build.

	. Another option is to check out the Hugging Face tasks page, to get a more in-depth intro to common ML/AI tasks.

* Spaces
--------
Learn about Hugging Face Hub’s Spaces feature for easily building and hosting ML demo apps.

Key ideas:

	. Spaces is a feature on Hugging Face Hub for building and hosting ML demo apps.

	. Using Spaces allows an ML developer to quickly create a demo app with a user interface for interacting with a model.

	. Building a demo on Spaces requires only a few lines of code using Python packages like Gradio and Streamlit.

	. Note that while basic Spaces are free, more advanced Spaces (like those requiring GPUs) may require a paid upgrade.

Question: what are the advantages to using Spaces as an ML developer?
---------

* See our answer
----------------
While building and hosting an app from scratch gives developers more flexibility, using Spaces lets ML developers quickly build user interfaces to demo their models without worrying about 
all the technical details. Spaces is also a community of ML developers, which can help a demo get noticed by other devs!
